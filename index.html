                      <h3>The Importance of Self-Care for Mental Health</h3>
                      <p>
                        Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, act, make choices, and relate to others. Mental health is more than the absence of a mental illness—it’s essential to your overall health and quality of life. Self-care can play a role in maintaining your mental health and help support your treatment and recovery if you have a mental illness.

                      <p>
                        Everyone experiences pain at some point, but in people with depression or anxiety, pain can become particularly intense and hard to treat. People suffering from depression, for example, tend to experience more severe and long-lasting pain than other people.

                      <p>
                        Many of us know that we feel better after “a good night’s sleep” and more grumpy or foggy if sleep deprived.
